## Dependencies

The experiments are tested under Ubuntu18.04 and OSX. Docker images will be published in due course to ensure wider reproducibility.

`R` dependencies.
```r
    yaml
    MASS
    cubature
    lhs
    data.tree
    dbarts
    matrixStats
    mvtnorm
    doParallel
    kernlab
    msm
    MCMCglmm
    dbarts_0.9-8
    caret
    reticulate
    rdist
```

`Python` dependencies
```
torch 
gpytorch
```

## Numerical Experiments: Genz Functions

1) Install all the necessary packages

```r
install.packages(c("yaml", "MASS", "cubature", "lhs", "data.tree", "matrixStats", "mvtnorm", "doParallel", "kernlab", "msm", "MCMCglmm", "caret", "reticulate", "rdist"))

# an old version of dbarts
packageurl <- "https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/dbarts/dbarts_0.9-8.tar.gz"
install.packages(packageurl, repos=NULL, type="source")
```
*Note that the older version of `dbarts` is needed as there had been significant changes in the class files for the data structures*

Now for the Python dependencies, we will use following
```
gpytorch
torch
```
This is done in `src/optimise_gp.R` by creating a virtualenv with the function `install_python_env()` using `reticulate`.

2) Save the computed integrals
```
Rscript saveComputeIntegrals.R
```
This will store the ground truth in `results/genz/integrals.csv`

3) To reproduce the benchmark tests, run `integrationMain.R` with customized inputs. There are 8 arguments in total, of which the last three are optional. The penultimate argument should only be specified when the step function is used (`genz_function_number = 7`), and is set to `1` if not specified. For example:
```
Rscript integrationMain.R dimension num_iterations genz_function_number kernel_name sequential_flag (measure) (number_of_jumps_for_step_function) (save_posterior)
```
where `genz_function_number` follows the indexing in this [documentation](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/integration.html) for the Genz families. The results will be stored in `results`, where you can find the `.csv` and `.RData` files containing the numerical values and the automatically generated graphs. For example, one could run this
```
Rscript integrationMain.R 1 2 1 matern32 1 uniform 1 1
```
and get results for the continuous function, 2 iterations of sequential design, 1 dimension, matern32 kernel, 1 meaning with sequential design, uniform measure, 1 as a placeholder for the argument involving the number of jumps for a step function, and 1 to indicate whether to save the BART posterior samples at each iteration. For more information, check the first few lines of `integrationMain.R`.

Results will also be stored in `results/genz` and `Figures/genz`.

**Navigating the results**
Check the [Genz Functions](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/integration.html) and see the preprint for more information.

- 1: Continuous 
- 2: Corner Peak
- 3: Discontinuous
- 4: Gaussian Peak 
- 5: Oscillatory
- 6: Product Peak
- 7: Step function
- 9: Additive Gaussian 

## Numerical Experiments: Bayesian Survey Design

1) Install the dependencies in `R`. Make sure you are using **R 3.5.0** or higher.

2) Download and process the dataset
```
Rscript data/extract.R
cd data;unzip 2016csv_pil.zip; cd ..; Rscript data/sample_full.R
```

This will create `train2.csv` and `candidate2.csv`, which store the possible initial design points and the candidate points.

3)[optional] To compute the BART groundtruth, run

```
Rscript bart_compute_groundtruth.R num_cv_start num_cv_end num_data num_design 1
```
where `num_cv_start` and `num_cv_end` indicate a loop over possible random seeds with seeding `num_cv_start, num_cv_start+1,..,num_cv_end`, `num_data` is the number of candidate points and `num_design` is the number of initial design points. This can also be computed as the user wishes. The ground truths will be stored in `results/survey_design`.

4) To run the experiments, first navigate to `src/meanPopulationStudy/gpMean.R` and change the jitter/nugget term according to what you deem is appropriate. We set it to what we obtain from the output of the maximum marginal likelihood estimator using line 84 in `poptMean_trained_bin.R`. Note that some small jitter is always needed for numerical stability during the kernel matrix inversion for GP-BQ. Then run
```
Rscript poptMean_trained_bin.R num_new_surveys num_cv_start num_cv_end num_data num_design
```
where `num_new_surveys` is the number of new surveys to query.

For example, we used `num_new_surveys=200, num_data=10000, num_design=20`.

This will generate and store the results in `results/survey_design` and `Figures/survey_design`, where you can find the `.csv` and `.RData` files containing the numerical values and the automatically generated graphs.

*Note that the experiments can also be easily run using other BART packages such as `BART` or `bartMachine`, provided that `src/survey_design/bartMean.R` is edited so that `dbarts::bart` is replaced*
